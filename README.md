# Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 🌍 Project Overview

This Power BI project presents an analytical dashboard for Air Quality Index (AQI) across various regions of India. The dashboard helps visualize pollution trends, compare AQI levels across cities, and identify critical zones and pollutants affecting air quality.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track AQI variations across Indian states and cities
- Identify regions with hazardous air quality levels
- Analyze the most frequent pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, etc.)
- Compare air quality seasonally and annually
- Provide insights for environmental policy and public awareness

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

- City and State names  
- Date and Time of data collection  
- AQI values  
- Concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3  
- AQI Category (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)

> **Note**: Data sourced from open government datasets and environmental monitoring portals.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** for data visualization and interactive dashboards  
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and shaping  
- **DAX** for calculated metrics and KPIs  

## 📊 Key Insights

- Northern Indian cities showed the highest average AQI, especially during winter  
- PM2.5 and PM10 were the most dominant pollutants  
- Seasonal spikes in AQI were observed during festival periods (e.g., Diwali)  
- Cities like Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Kanpur consistently ranked among the most polluted  
- Cleaner air observed in coastal and southern regions

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time AQI monitoring using API feeds  
- Predictive modeling for AQI based on weather and emissions  
- Mobile-friendly versions of the dashboard
